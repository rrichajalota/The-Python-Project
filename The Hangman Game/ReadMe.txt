About the Game

Hangman is a paper and pencil guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of
a word, phrase or sentence and the other tries to guess it by suggesting letters or 
numbers, within a certain number of guesses.
The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes, representing each letter of the 
word. If the guessing player suggests a letter which occurs in the word, the other 
player writes it in all its correct positions. If the suggested letter or number does 
not occur in the word, the other player draws one element of a hanged man stick figure 
as a tally mark.

The flow of the game goes as follows:
1) At the start of the game,let the user know how many letters the computer's 
word contains.
2) Ask the user to supply one guess (i.e. letter) per round.
3) The user receives feedback immediately after each guess about whether their guess 
appears in the computer's word.
4) After each round, display to the user the partially guessed word so far, as well as 
letters that the user has not yet guessed.
5) A user is allowed 8 guesses. Make sure to remind the user of how many guesses 
s/he has left after each round. Assume that players will only ever submit one character 
at a time (A-Z).
6) A user loses a guess only when s/he guesses incorrectly.
If the user guesses the same letter twice, do not take away a guess - instead, print 
a message letting them know they've already guessed that letter and ask them to try again.
7) The game should end when the user constructs the full word or runs out of guesses. 
If the player runs out of guesses (s/he "loses"), reveal the word to the user when 
the game ends.
